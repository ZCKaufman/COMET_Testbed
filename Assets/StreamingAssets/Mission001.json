      "MissionInfo": "The purpose of this EVA is to traverse to points of interest (POIs) provided to the IVA team. In this planning phase, EVA must plan an order of POIs to visit (EVA Mapping tab) and work directly with the IVA team to build a task list for visiting these sites (EVA Task List tab).   EVA: Your team will have exclusive access to the multiple map overlays (Satellite, Contours, Solar, and Terrain) to assist you in planning your task.  You will have access to a step-by-step blank task list for completing this EVA. Your IVA teammates have high level outlines of similar EVA task lists that NASA has created, and you may query them for guidance as you are building yours.   IVA: You will have exclusive access to locations with POIs to assist EVA in planning the task. You will have access to high level step-by-step task lists that NASA has created for completing similar EVAs. Your EVA teammates do not have access to this and may query you for guidance as they are building their task list. You are permitted to answer their questions with as much information as they need.
